# About the project

This is the course diary for the course Introduction to Data Science, organized by University of Helsinki in Fall 2022. Here I will update my progress on the course, as well as the actual course work during the next six weeks. I heard about the course through a mailing list and it caught my attention as it is could support my research. I do empirical research in macroeconomics and therefore I deal with large data sets on a daily basis.  This is why it is useful for me to learn new routines and ideas on data management.
